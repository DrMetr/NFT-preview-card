## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I started this challenge with an idea of adding a JS script that would scrape info about etherium price from a certain website and then update the price in in accordance with relevant prices. Unfortunately, after spending an evening trying to follow multiple guides and stackoverflow dicussions I came to a conclusion that I should postpone this part of the project until I get comfortable with async/await, node.js and axios and cheerio or other webscrapping tools.

### Continued development

To learn async/await, node.js and axios and cheerio. I plan to re-upload the result later.

### Useful resources

- [How to Apply Borders to Clip Paths with CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/apply-borders-to-clip-paths-with-css/) - This didn't help me anywhere but I've encountered it during my researches.
- [How to Web Scrape With JavaScript & Node.js (Step by Step)](https://www.scraperapi.com/web-scraping/javascript/) - the guide I used to build the scraper but it doesn't explain how to use the data obtained in furhter work, i.e. not for beginners like me.
